I needed those shorts and I was\\ngoing to be late, but I didn't want to interrupt an\\nargument between my teachers. I recognised the voices:\\nMr. Schmidt, my History teacher and Mr. Boone, my Math\\nteacher. They seemed to be arguing about me. I couldn't\\nbelieve it.

He\\nturned to me and asked quietly, ‘What does a scholarship\\nJacket mean?’\\n13 13 13 13 13 I answered quickly; maybe there was a chance. ‘It\\nmeans you've earned it by having the highest grades for\\neight years and that's why they're giving it to you. ’ Too\\nlate I realized the significance of my words.\\nGrandpa knew that I understood it was not a matter of\\nmoney.

Children must go to school and not be financially exploited. In the poor\\ncountries of the world, 60% of the present population is under 25 years of age.

In conflict-ridden areas in particular, the violation of children’s\\nrights leads to the continuation of violence from generation to generation.\\nShowing great personal courage, Kailash Satyarthi, maintaining Gandhi’s tradition,\\nhas headed various forms of protests and demonstrations, all peaceful, focusing\\non the grave exploitation of children for financial gain. He has also contributed to\\nthe development of important international conventions on children’s rights.\\nDespite her youth, Malala Yousafzai has already fought for several years for the\\nright of girls to education, and has shown by example that children and young\\npeople, too, can contribute to improving their own situations. This she has done\\nunder the most dangerous circumstances. Through her heroic struggle she has\\nbecome a leading spokesperson for girls’ rights to education.\\nThe Nobel Committee regards it as an important point for an Indian and a Pakistani,\\nto join in a common struggle for education and against extremism. Many other\\nindividuals and institutions in the international community have also contributed.\\nIt has been calculated that there are 168 million child labourers around the world\\ntoday. In 2000 the figure was 78 million higher.

The scholarship Jacket had a big gold ‘S’ on the\\nleft front side and your name written in gold letters on\\nthe pocket.\\n2 2 2 2 2 My oldest sister, Rosie, had won the Jacket a few\\nyears back, and I fully expected to also. I was fourteen\\nand in the eighth grade. I had been a straight ‘A’\\nstudent since the first grade and this last year had\\nlooked forward very much to owning that Jacket. My\\nfather was a farm labourer who couldn\\'t earn enough\\nmoney to feed eight children. So when I was six I was\\ngiven to my grandparents to raise.\\nAn award is a mark of recognition given in honour of one’s excellence in a certain field. Do\\nyou dream of getting such awards? If so, what stands in the way of your dreams?\\nHere, in this story the narrator speaks about the obstacles she had to encounter to make\\nher dream come true.\\nMarta Salinas (born 1949) is a native of\\nCoalinga, California. She graduated in creative\\nwriting from the University of California at\\nIrvine. The Scholarship Jacket  is one of the\\nseveral short stories Salinas has published in\\njournals and collections.\\n1. What was the tradition\\nfollowed in the small\\nTexas school?\\n2. What do you think the\\nletter  \\'S\\' on the Jacket\\nrepresent?\\nThe Scholarship Jacket\\n\\n114\\n3 3 3 3 3 We couldn\\'t participate in sports at school\\nbecause there were registration fees, uniform\\ncosts, and trips out of town; so, even though our\\nfamily was quite agile and athletic there would\\nnever be a school sports Jacket for us. This one,\\nthe scholarship Jacket, was our only chance.\\n4 4 4 4 4 In May, close to graduation, spring fever had\\nstruck as usual with a vengeancewith a vengeancewith a vengeancewith a vengeancewith a vengeance. No one paid\\nany attention in class; instead we stared out of\\nthe windows and at each other, wanting to\\nspeed up the last few weeks of school. I\\ndespairdespairdespairdespairdespair ededededed every time I looked in the mirror.\\nPencil thin, not a curve anywhere. I was called\\n‘beanpole’ and ‘string bean’ and I knew that\\'s\\nwhat I looked like. That really wasn\\'t much for a\\nfourteen-year-old to work with, I thought, as I absent-\\nmindedly wandered from my history class to the gym.\\nAnother hour of sweating in basketball and displaying\\nmy toothpick legs was coming up. Then I remembered\\nmy P .E. shorts were still in a bag under my desk where\\nI\\'d forgotten them. I had to walk all the way back and\\nget them. Coach Thompson was a real bear if someone\\nwasn\\'t dressed for P .E. She had said I was a good\\nforward and even tried to talk Grandma into letting me\\njoin the team once. Of course Grandma said no.\\n5 5 5 5 5 I was almost back at my classroom door when I heard\\nvoices raised in anger as if in some sort of argumentargumentargumentargumentargument. I\\nstopped. I didn\\'t mean to eavesdropeavesdropeavesdropeavesdropeavesdrop, I just hesitated, not\\nknowing what to do. I needed those shorts and I was\\ngoing to be late, but I didn\\'t want to interrupt an\\nargument between my teachers. I recognised the voices:\\nMr. Schmidt, my History teacher and Mr. Boone, my Math\\nteacher. They seemed to be arguing about me. I couldn\\'t\\nbelieve it. I still remember the feeling of shock that\\nrooted me flat against the wall as if I were trying to\\nblend in with the graffitigraffitigraffitigraffitigraffiti written there.\\n‘I refuse to do it! I don\\'t care who her father is, her\\ngrades don\\'t even begin to compare to Martha\\'s. I won\\'t\\nlie or fffffalsifyalsifyalsifyalsifyalsify r ecords. Martha has a straight A-plus\\naverage and you know it. ’ That was Mr. Schmidt and he\\nsounded very angry. Mr. Boone\\'s voice sounded calm\\n3. ‘This one, the\\nScholarship Jacket, was\\nour only chance.’ Why\\ndoes Martha say so?\\n4. How does Martha\\ndescribe herself?\\n5. What were Martha’s\\nteachers arguing about?\\n\\n115\\nand quiet.\\n‘Look. Joann\\'s father is not only on the Board, he owns\\nthe only store in town. We could say it was a close tie\\nand-’\\n6 6 6 6 6 The pounding in my ears drowned out the rest of the\\nwords, only a word here and there filtered through.\\n‘Martha is Mexican . . . resign . . . won\\'t do it . . . . ’\\nMr. Schmidt came rushing out and luckily for me went\\ndown the opposite way towards the auditorium, so he\\ndidn\\'t see me.\\nShaking, I waited a few minutes and then went in and\\ngrabbed my bag and fled from the room. Mr Boone\\nlooked up when I came in but didn\\'t say anything. To\\nthis day I don\\'t remember if I got in trouble in P .E. for\\nbeing late or how I made it through the rest of the\\nafternoon. I went home very sad and cried into my\\npillow that night so Grandmother wouldn\\'t hear me.\\n7 7 7 7 7 It seemed a cruel coincidencecoincidencecoincidencecoincidencecoincidence that I had overheard\\nthat conversation. The next day when the principal\\ncalled me into his office I knew what it would be about.\\nHe looked uncomfortable and unhappy. I decided I\\nwasn\\'t going to make it any easier for him, so I looked\\nhim straight in the eyes. He looked away and fidgetedfidgetedfidgetedfidgetedfidgeted\\nwith the papers on his desk.\\n‘Martha, ’ he said, ‘there’s been a change in policy this\\nyear regarding the scholarship Jacket. As you know, it\\nhas always been free. ’ He cleared his throat and\\ncontinued. ‘This year the Board has decided to charge\\nfifteen dollars, which still won\\'t cover the complete cost\\nof the Jacket. ’\\n8 8 8 8 8 I stared at him in shock, and a small sound of dismaydismaydismaydismaydismay\\nescaped my throat. I hadn\\'t expected this. He still\\navoided looking in my eyes.\\n‘So if you are unable to pay the fifteen dollars for the\\nJacket, it will be given to the next one in line. ’ I didn\\'t\\nneed to ask who that was.\\n9 9 9 9 9 Standing with all the dignity I could muster, I said, ‘I\\'ll\\nspeak to my grandfather about it, sir, and let you know\\ntomorrow. ’ I cried on the walk home from the bus stop.\\nThe dirt road was a quarter mile from the highway. So\\n6. Why was Mr. Boone\\narguing in Joann’s favour?\\n7. ‘It seemed a cruel\\ncoincidence’ Why did\\nMartha say so?\\n8. Why was the principal\\n‘uncomfortable and\\nunhappy’?\\n9. Why was Martha\\nshocked?\\n\\n116\\nby the time I got home, my eyes were red and pufpufpufpufpuffyfyfyfyfy.\\n‘Where\\'s Grandpa?’ I asked Grandma, looking down at\\nthe floor so she wouldn\\'t ask me why I\\'d been crying.\\nShe was sewing on a quilt as usual and didn\\'t look up.\\n‘I think he\\'s out back working in the bean field. ’\\n10 10 10 10 10 I went outside and looked out at the fields. There he\\nwas. I could see him walking between the rows, his\\nbody bent over the little plants, hoehoehoehoehoe in hand. I walked\\nslowly out to him, trying to think how I could best ask\\nhim for the money. There was a cool breeze blowing and\\na sweet smell of mesquitemesquitemesquitemesquitemesquite fr uit in the air, but I didn\\'t\\nappreciate it. I kicked at a dirt clodclodclodclodclod. I wanted that Jacket\\nso much. It was more than just being a valedictorian and\\ngiving a little thank you speech for the Jacket on\\ngraduation night. It represented eight years of hard work\\nand expectation.\\nI knew I had to be honest with Grandpa; it was my only\\nchance. He saw my shadow and looked up.\\n11 11 11 11 11 He waited for me to speak. I cleared my throat\\nnervously and clasped my hands behind my back so he\\nwouldn\\'t see them shaking. ‘Grandpa, I have a big favour\\nto ask you, ’ I said in Spanish, the only language he knew.\\n12 12 12 12 12 He still waited silently. I tried again. ‘Grandpa, this year\\nthe principal said the scholarship Jacket is not going to\\nbe free. It\\'s going to cost fifteen dollars, and I have to\\ntake the money in tomorrow, otherwise it\\'ll be given to\\nsomeone else. ’ The last words came out in an eager rush.\\nGrandpa straightened up tiredly and leaned his chin on\\nthe hoe handle. He looked out over the field that was\\nfilled with the tiny green bean plants. I waited,\\ndesperately hoping he\\'d say I could have the money. He\\nturned to me and asked quietly, ‘What does a scholarship\\nJacket mean?’\\n13 13 13 13 13 I answered quickly; maybe there was a chance. ‘It\\nmeans you\\'ve earned it by having the highest grades for\\neight years and that\\'s why they\\'re giving it to you. ’ Too\\nlate I realized the significance of my words.\\nGrandpa knew that I understood it was not a matter of\\nmoney. It wasn\\'t that. He went back to hoeing the weeds\\nthat sprang up between the delicate little bean plants.\\n10. Why was winning the\\nScholarship Jacket\\nimportant to Martha?\\n11. Why did Martha’s\\ngrandfather refuse to pay\\nthe money?\\n\\n117\\nIt was a time-consuming job; sometimes\\nthe small shoots were right next to each\\nother. Finally he spoke again as I turned\\nto leave, crying.\\n‘Then if you pay for it, Martha, it\\'s not a\\nscholarship Jacket, is it? Tell your\\nprincipal I will not pay the fifteen\\ndollars. ’\\n14 14 14 14 14 I walked back to the house and\\nlocked myself in the bathroom for a long\\ntime. I was angry with Grandfather even\\nthough I knew he was right, and I was\\nangry with the Board, whoever they\\nwere. Why did they have to change the\\nrules just when it was my turn to win\\nthe Jacket?\\nThose were the days of belief and\\ninnocence.\\nIt was a very sad and withdrawn girl\\nwho dragged into the principal\\'s office\\nthe next day. This time he did look me in\\nthe eyes.\\n‘What did your grandfather say?’\\nI sat very straight in my chair.\\n‘He said to tell you he won\\'t pay the fifteen dollars. ’\\n15 15 15 15 15 The principal muttered something I couldn\\'t\\nunderstand under his breath and walked over to the\\nwindow. He stood looking at something outside. He\\nlooked bigger than usual when he stood up; he was a\\ntall, gaunt gauntgaunt gauntgaunt man with gray hair, and I watched the back\\nof his head while I waited for him to speak.\\n‘Why?’ he finally asked. ‘Your grandfather has the\\nmoney. He owns a two-hundred acre r rr rranc ancanc ancanch hh hh. ’\\n16 16 16 16 16 I looked at him, forcing my eyes to stay dry. ‘I know,\\nsir, but he said if I had to pay for it, then it wouldn\\'t be a\\nscholarship Jacket. ’ I stood up to leave. ‘I guess you\\'ll just\\nhave to give it to Joann. ’ I hadn\\'t meant to say that, it\\nhad just slipped out. I was almost to the door when he\\nstopped me. ‘Martha-wait. ’\\n12. Why was the principal\\ndisturbed when Martha’s\\ngrandfather refused to pay\\nthe money?\\n NT-573-2-ENGLISH-10 Vol-2\\n\\n118\\n17 17 17 17 17 I turned and looked at him, waiting. What did he want\\nnow? I could feel my heart pounding loudly in my chest.\\nSomething bitter and vilevilevilevilevile tasting was coming up in my\\nmouth; I was afraid I was going to be sick. I didn\\'t need\\nany sympathy speeches. He sighed loudly and went back\\nto his big desk.\\nHe watched me, biting his lip. ‘Okay. We\\'ll make an\\nexception in your case. I\\'ll tell the Board, you\\'ll get your\\nJacket. ’\\n18 18 18 18 18 I could hardly believe my ears. I spoke in a trembling\\nrush. ‘Oh, thank you, sir!’ Suddenly I felt great. I didn\\'t\\nknow about adrenalinadrenalinadrenalinadrenalinadrenalin in those days, but I knew\\nsomething was pumping through me, making me feel as\\ntall as the sky. I wanted to yell, jump, run the mile, do\\nsomething.\\nI ran out so I could cry in the hall where there was no\\none to see me.\\nAt the end of the day, Mr. Schmidt winked at me and\\nsaid, ‘I hear you\\'re getting the scholarship Jacket this\\nyear. ’\\n19 19 19 19 19 His face looked as happy and innocent as a baby\\'s,\\nbut I knew better. Without answering I gave him a quick\\nhug and ran to the bus. I cried on the walk home again,\\nbut this time because I was so happy. I couldn\\'t wait to\\ntell Grandpa and ran straight to the field. I joined him in\\nthe row where he was working, and without saying\\nanything I crouchedcrouchedcrouchedcrouchedcrouched down and started pulling up the\\nweeds with my hands. Grandpa worked alongside me\\nfor a few minutes, and he didn\\'t ask what had\\nhappened. After I had a little pilepilepilepilepile of weeds between the\\nrows, I stood up and faced him.\\n‘The principal said he\\'s making an exception for me,\\nGrandpa, and I\\'m getting the Jacket after all. That\\'s after I\\ntold him what you said. ’\\n20 20 20 20 20 Grandpa didn\\'t say anything; he just gave me a pat on\\nthe shoulder and a smile. He pulled out the crumpledcrumpledcrumpledcrumpledcrumpled\\nred handkerchief that he always carried in his back\\npocket and wiped the sweat off his forehead.\\n‘Better go see if your grandmother needs any help with\\nsupper. ’\\nI gave him a big grin.

Children must go to school and not be financially exploited. In the poor\\ncountries of the world, 60% of the present population is under 25 years of age.

In conflict-ridden areas in particular, the violation of children’s\\nrights leads to the continuation of violence from generation to generation.\\nShowing great personal courage, Kailash Satyarthi, maintaining Gandhi’s tradition,\\nhas headed various forms of protests and demonstrations, all peaceful, focusing\\non the grave exploitation of children for financial gain. He has also contributed to\\nthe development of important international conventions on children’s rights.\\nDespite her youth, Malala Yousafzai has already fought for several years for the\\nright of girls to education, and has shown by example that children and young\\npeople, too, can contribute to improving their own situations.

In his\\nimagination he distinctly saw his grand dad, Konstantin\\nMakarich. He was a night watchman on the estate of\\nsome gentle folk called Zhivarev. He was small, lean, old,\\nman about sixtyfive, but remarkably lively and agile with\\na smiling face and eyes bleary with drink. In the day\\ntime he either slept at the kitchen or sat joking with the\\ncook and kitchen-maids. In the night he wrapped\\nhimself in a great sheepskin coat, walked round and\\nround the estate, sounding his rrrrrattleattleattleattleattle.  Two dogs, Eel and\\nKashtanka would follow him withwithwithwithwith drooping headsdrooping headsdrooping headsdrooping headsdrooping heads. Eel\\nwas named on account of his black coat and long\\nweasel-like body. He was wonderfully respectful and\\ninsinuatinginsinuatinginsinuatinginsinuatinginsinuating.

His\\nrattle would be fastened to his belt. He would be\\nthrowing out his arms and hugging himself against the\\ncold, or, with his old man\\'s titter, pinching a maid, or\\none of the cooks. ‘Have a nip, ’ he would say, holding out\\nhis snuffbox to the women. The women would take a\\npinch and sneeze. Grandfather would be overcome with\\ndelight, breaking out into jolly laughter, and shouting:\\n‘Good for frozen noses!’\\n5 5 5 5 5 Even the dogs would be given snuff. Kashtanka would\\nsneeze, shake her head and walk away, offended. But\\nEel, too polite to sneeze, would wag his tail. And the\\nweather was glorious.

What was their\\nsolution to that?\\nRabindranath Tagore  (1861-1941) is a Bengali\\nwriter who reshaped Bengali literature and\\nmusic as well as Indian art in the late 19th and\\nearly 20th centuries. He became the first non-\\nEuropean to win the Nobel Prize for Literature\\nfor his celebrated work Gitanjali, famous for its\\n‘profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse’.\\nThe Golden Boat, Cabuliwalah, The Post Office and The Broken Nest\\nare some of his notable works. This is an extract from his\\nautobiographical work My Boyhood Days.\\nIn the story Vanka we see the pathetic plight of a little boy and feel sympathy\\ntowards him. Shouldn’t we empathise with others in such situations. Let us\\nread a story written by Tagore.\\n\\n163\\n\"Ah! Your doctor knows everything. Let him know that a\\nrecovered person never needs further medicated recovery.\\nI can go home right now.\"\\n\"No, now you know that all sorts of illness have eluded from\\nhere.\"\\n\"Mm. Now I suppose everyone here would be perfectly\\nwell in this storm.\"\\nSharat looked at her face. She still appeared to be very weak.\\nHis heart sank at the thought of how narrowly she had\\nescaped death.\\nKiran had enjoyed being with the villagers steaming with\\nfun. But here in the riverside, she could not tolerate with the\\nheavy burden of doing nothing. That was their point of\\ndiscussion. He lost his spirit when she suddenly stopped\\nresponding and turned her head away.\\nHe heard a call and went outside to see a young boy in the\\ngarden, a survivor from an upturned boat in the storm.\\nImmediately, Kiran showed her hospitality giving him dry\\nclothes to change and milk to drink. After he had settled\\ndown, she asked his where abouts. His name was Nilkanta,\\nbelonged to a theatrical group. Their boat perished in the\\nstorm while they were going to stage a play in a\\nneighbouring villa. He said he had no idea about the others.\\nThe boy turned out to be a boon to everyone there. Kiran\\nhad a warm interest in him  as he swam out from the\\nclutches of death. Sharat and his mother were happy as\\nKiran would stay longer there. Nilkanta also was delighted\\nto escape from his master and be a part of that wealthy\\nfamily.\\nBut in a short while Sharat and his mother began to rethink\\nand longed for his departure. He developed a vast friendship\\nband of naughty boys which didn\\'t allow any fruits to get\\nripen in the neighbourhood. His friendship with the village\\nmongrel dog turned the house upside down. But Kiran\\nalone found happiness in supporting the boy.  All the\\nwarnings of Sharat went in vain. She provided him clothes in\\nabundance. She would always call him for his theatrical\\npresentations and the afternoon hours passed merrily.\\nSharat had a cordial dislike towards the boy.  Though the boy\\noften got his ears boxed and pulled by Sharat, there was no\\nnotable change. He strongly believed the world was made\\n3. \" a recovered person\\nnever needs further\\nrecovery.\" What did Kiran\\nmean by that?\\n4. Kiran enjoyed interacting\\nwith people and hated being\\ninactive. Pick out the\\nsentences which give this\\nsense.\\n5. Who was the new guest to\\nthe riverside house? How\\ndid he come there? How did\\nKiran treat him?\\n6. The boy\\'s entry was a\\nboon to everyone. How?\\n7. Why did Sharat and his\\nmother long for the\\ndeparture of Nilkanta?\\n\\n164\\nup of eatings and beatings in which beatings played the\\npredominant part.\\nIt was hard to tell his age from his face and his acts. His\\nhairless innocent face said he was about fourteen but the\\nsmoke and words gushed out from his mouth suggested he\\nwas beyond seventeen. But everyone treated him as a small\\nboy. He showed the first signs of adulthood when he\\nhesitated to be a lady companion to Kiran and to play the\\nearlier feminine roles he had played. But his role as an\\nacolyte to Kiran defended anything that came against him in\\nthe house. He had nothing to think about other than\\nentertaining Kiran with his diverse performances.\\nKiran\\'s efforts to inculcate some scholastic elements in him\\nturned into ashes as the destitute youth figured out that\\neven the alphabets were dancing in the mist in front of his\\neyes. But he developed the skill of casting his eyes blank on\\na page in the book for hours as if reading it. He would read it\\naloud when a hint of human presence is somewhere around\\nhim. Even though it sounded perfect with full of trifling\\nalliteration, the feeblest meaning was beyond his\\ncomprehension.\\nHe felt everything to become music around him. The past\\nlife of the theatrical slave before the storm had completely\\nfaded out from his memory. The enchanting nature and the\\nsoothing presence of Kiran, who took up the roles of his\\nsister and mother combined, became the music of his song.\\nAnd off from her, he would bring dozens of fresh\\ncomplaints from his neighbours that eventually led to Sharat\\ncuffing him. His spoilt followers would then come in search\\nof him for some new ways of mischief.\\nAt that time Sharat\\'s younger brother Satish came to spend\\nvacation with them. Kiran was overjoyed by the presence of\\nher brother-in-law of the same age, both always on the move,\\nrollicking with pearls of laughter. She would write monkey\\nwith vermilion on his back and he, put pepper among her\\nbetel.\\nMeanwhile no one knew how, a cloud of unexplained\\nwilderness hovered over Nilkanta. He would thrash his\\ndevotees for no reason and kick his pet mongrel or smash\\nthe leaves and twigs harshly with canes.\\nAfter Satish\\'s arrival, Kiran had seldom got much time to\\nspare serving Nilkanta\\'s meals which she had been doing so\\n8. Though Sharat punished\\nhim for his naughtiness,\\nNilkanta did not change his\\nbehaviour. What was the\\nreason behind that?\\n9. What was the confusion\\nabout Nilkanta\\'s age with\\nhis face and deeds?\\n10. Nilkanta turned out to\\nbe a failure in his studies.\\nHow did his studies go on?\\n11. The care and affection\\nof Kiran changed the boy\\'s\\nmiserable life to a happy\\none. How did he behave\\nwhen he was away from\\nKiran\\'s presence?\\n\\n165\\n14. What grave problem\\ndid Kiran and family have\\nwhen they were about to\\nmove to their house in the\\nvillage?\\n15. Why did Nilkanta\\nthink about burning Satish\\ninto ashes?\\n13. How did Nilkanta\\navenge Satish in his own\\nway?\\ngenerously as he had an immense capacity of eating. After\\nthat he left the hall without eating much. He would\\nrepeatedly say, \"I am not hungry\" thinking that it would\\nbring Kiran to press him to finish. That didn\\'t happen.\\nSoaking the pillow with his sobs became a usual occurrence.\\nHe jumped into the conclusion that some venomous trick of\\nSatish had made her angry against him.\\nSatish didn\\'t notice his covert ways of avenge even though\\nhis soap disappeared from the steps of the bathing-place or\\nhis dress floated past him as if blown by the wind. One day\\nKiran called Nilkanta to entertain Satish. He kept mum and\\nsaid that he couldn\\'t remember anything.\\nThe decision to return home made everyone busy packing\\nup. Satish was going with them, but Nilkanta remained\\nunasked. Later, Kiran\\'s proposal of taking him with them was\\nstrongly opposed by the other members of the family.\\nFinally Kiran softly advised him to go back to his own home.\\nThis unexpected kindness made him burst into tears. Kiran\\ncouldn\\'t stop joining him. But Satish was terribly annoyed at\\nthe sight of this and said, \"That brat has cleverly discovered a\\nway to soften your heart with a tear or two. Because you are\\ntoo good and trustful.\" Nilkanta left the spot with a bleeding\\nheart seriously thinking about how to burn Satish into ashes.\\nSatish had brought a grand inkstand with him, his great\\nfavourite, from Calcutta.  The inkpot was set on a pearl boat\\ndrawn by a silver goose supporting a pen-holder. Everyday\\nhe cleaned it with added care.\\nThe day before they were about to depart, the inkstand was\\nmissing. Satish was furious and pounced upon the boy\\nshouting, \"You have stolen my inkstand, you thief!\" Nilkanta\\nwobbled towards the wall with a swollen heart and head.\\nKiran was greatly distressed at the scene and took him to\\nanother room and suggested, \"Nilu, if you have taken it, I\\nshall keep it there and block anyone making further fuss.\" To\\nthis, Nilkanta knelt down weeping bitterly.  A fierce battle of\\nwords followed between Kiran on one side and Sharat and\\nSatish on the other.  Satish wanted to search his room and\\nshe responded violently with tears: \"You dare?\" That at once\\nsettled the matter.\\nKiran\\'s heart overflowed with pity on the homeless lad. She\\ngot two new suits of clothes, a pair of shoes and a bank note\\nand wanted to place them into his box as a surprise gift.\\n12.

She started pulling out everything to place them in order.\\nThere at the bottom came a layer of linen and under it\\nemerged the missing inkstand, goose and all.

Actually he took the inkstand as a\\nrevenge to throw it into the river. Now there is no way of\\nconvincing his mistress. He somehow managed to leave the\\nroom without Kiran noticing him. Kiran, with a deep sigh,\\nplaced them back in the box well, the gift on top of all and\\nclosed the box.\\nThe next day the boy was nowhere to be found. Even the\\npolice couldn\\'t find him. Sharat urged for searching in his\\nbox to know more about him but Kiran\\'s refusal forced him\\nto withdraw.  She took the missing things and threw them in\\nthe river.
